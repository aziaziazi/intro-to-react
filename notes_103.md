# Next course

Next Codecademy course annonced at the end of 102 :

"
Stay tuned for our intermediate-level React course, Building an Interactive React Application. Instead of learning more new tools, you will be focused on applying the tools that you have already learned. How many components should an app have? Which components should use props, and which should use state? Who should pass what information to whom? These are the kinds of structural questions that we will address in Building an Interactive React Application.

# Installing and configuring React

Codecademy article explaining the steps one by one :

1. [React and ReactDOM](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/react-setup-i)
2. [Babel](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/react-setup-ii)
3. [Webpack](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/react-setup-iii)
4. [HTMLWebpackPlugin](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/react-setup-iv)
5. [Conclusion](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/react-setup-v)

The process is quite tedious. I can bootstrap quickly with [facebookincubator's create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

(That looks to be a good starting guide)[https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/thinking-in-react.html]. They say :

1. Start with a mock
2. Break the UI into components hierarchy (like *boxifying* html)
3. Identify the minimal (but complete) UI states needed
4. Identify where my state should live
5. Add inverse Data flow
